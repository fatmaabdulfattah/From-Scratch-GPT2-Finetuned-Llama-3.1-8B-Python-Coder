Tom asked. Of course, my loves, Mom said. We can pray anytime, anywhere. He always hears us and answers us. Lets pray together. Mom held their hands and closed her eyes. Lily and Tom did the same.

Maybe he can be our friend. Sam nods and smiles too. He picks up the radish that the rabbit dropped and says, Okay, Mia. Lets share our vegetables with the rabbit. Maybe he will come back and say sorry. Maybe he will hear us and be nice. The twins go back to their patch and make a pile of radishes, carrots and lettuce.
